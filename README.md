# DeKagger

Removes bad results (malware / badware sites) from kaggi's search results.


## Why Dekagger ? 
In french "Caguer" means defecate. So the extension removes the 💩 from Kagi results 😁

If just like me you enjoy your privacy, give [Kagi](https://kagi.com) a try :)


## How to install ?
This is still a WIP, so before you can find it in some browser extension store, you'll have to laoded it unpacked:
⚠️  Only tested with Chromium and Firefox

Chromium:
 - go to manage extensions
 - enable developer mode
 - Hit "Load unpacked"
 - select the kagi-filter folder

Firefox:
 - open about:debugging
 - click This Firefox
 - click Load Temporary addon
 - select manifest.json
